>>> from units import *

Units are represented by classes.  For example, meter, kilogram, and second
are all classes in the units module.  Like int and str, instances of these classes
are immutable.

Arithmetic on units returns other units of the appropriate class.

>>> m*m
<class 'units.*m**2'>

The units library understands the difference between base units and derived
units, and is a little bit smart about how it treats them.

>>> kg*m/s**2
<class 'units.Newton'>
>>> N*m
<class 'units.Joule'>
>>> J/s
<class 'units.Watt'>

Multiplying a unit times anything will result in an instance of that unit, holding
onto the value.

>>> 5*m
5*m

Multiplying that instance by something else will multiply the value.

>>> 5*m*2.5
12.5*m

Multiplying two unit instances together will multiply their valus and classes.

>>> meter(5)**2
25*meter**2
